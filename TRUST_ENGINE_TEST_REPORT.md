# Trust Engine Test Report

## Verification scope

Revision under test includes the Phase 3 backend, API/WebSocket integration, React dashboard, and Android client synchronization. Tests use temporary SQLite databases except for normal application import initialization; the tracked database is restored after verification.

## Automated results

Command:

```text
python -m pytest -q api/test_cyber_threat_engine.py api/test_session_intelligence_phase3.py
```

Result: **13 passed** in 32.16 seconds. One third-party ReportLab deprecation warning was emitted.

Coverage implemented in `api/test_session_intelligence_phase3.py`:

| Test area | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Nine independent components | Network/threat change while device/runtime remain unchanged | PASS |
| Score bounds | All components remain 0–100 | PASS |
| Trust recovery | VPN removal restores network and threat trust | PASS |
| Recovery persistence | Positive component and overall deltas stored | PASS |
| Timeline/history | Ordered immutable snapshots for every event | PASS |
| Restart persistence | New repository instance restores context/passport | PASS |
| Lifecycle | Active, idle, challenged, and closed transitions | PASS |
| Recalculation performance | 30-run p95 assertion below 50 ms | PASS |
| REST contract | Sessions, passport, components, history, recalculate | PASS |
| WebSocket bootstrap | Session-scoped current passport frame | PASS |
| 1,000-session capacity | Registry stores and lists 1,000 active sessions | PASS |
| Existing threat integration | Real Cyber Threat Engine overlay object changes runtime, behavior, and threat trust | PASS |
| Concurrent sessions | 50 sessions update from 16 worker threads without state contamination | PASS |
| Broker propagation | Session-filtered delivery asserted below 200 ms | PASS |

## Performance evidence

An additional 200-event isolated measurement on the repository-backed reducer produced:

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---:|---:|
| Minimum recalculation | 1.828 ms | <50 ms |
| Median recalculation | 3.389 ms | <50 ms |
| p95 recalculation | 6.017 ms | <50 ms |
| Maximum recalculation | 27.488 ms | <50 ms |
| Broker propagation | Automated assertion <200 ms | <200 ms |

This measures the Session Intelligence reducer and local SQLite commit on the verification workstation. WebSocket internet latency depends on deployment topology and must be revalidated in staging.

## Build verification

| Artifact | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| React production build | `npm run build` in `web` | PASS; 3,148 modules |
| React assets | Vite output | 1,068,718 bytes |
| Android debug APK | Gradle 8.11.1 `:app:assembleDebug` with local Android SDK | PASS |
| Android APK size | `app-debug.apk` | 18,001,651 bytes |
| Python syntax | `python -m compileall -q api/session_intelligence api/main.py` | PASS |

The Android build also verified and corrected pre-existing blockers: invalid `debuggable` DSL, missing launcher resources, missing `savedInstanceState` call, and missing `MutableStateFlow` import.

## Compatibility checks

- Existing SDK event ACK is returned unchanged.
- Existing decision response is returned unchanged.
- Cyber Threat Engine tests remain separately runnable.
- No ML model file or prediction implementation was modified.
- Legacy `/session/*`, `/sdk/*`, and unscoped WebSocket clients remain present.
- Android simulator logs backend event IDs from real ACK responses; offline requests are labeled queued.

## Known operational limits

- The current broker is process-local. Horizontal multi-worker deployments require shared pub/sub for cross-worker WebSocket delivery.
- SQLite is suitable for this repository's single-service demonstration and verified 1,000-session registry. Production multi-node scale requires a shared transactional database.
- Android reconnect was compile-verified and code-reviewed; device/emulator network interruption instrumentation is still required in staging.
- No physical Android device was available for UI automation.
- React's existing bundle is over Vite's 500 kB chunk advisory; Phase 3 adds no new runtime dependency, but route-level code splitting remains recommended.

## Readiness

Phase 3 implementation meets its repository-level functional and performance assertions. Before national-scale production deployment, run distributed load, multi-worker pub/sub, authenticated API gateway, TLS/certificate pinning, and physical-device reconnect tests in the target environment.
